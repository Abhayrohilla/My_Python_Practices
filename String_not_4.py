# 5. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string. Go to the editor
# Sample String : 'abc', 'xyz'
# Expected Result : 'xyc abz'
# Sample = "abc", "xyz"
# Sample = str(Sample)
# c = Sample.strip(',')
# print(c)
# print(type(c))
txt = "abc", "xyz"
txt = list(txt)
# c = txt.strip('a')
#txt = txt.remove(',')
print(len(txt))
print(txt[0])
for i in txt:
    # txt = txt.strip(',')
    print(i)
